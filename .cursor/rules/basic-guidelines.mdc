## Project: Boompath Bash
A 3D mobile game developed in Unity 6 where units follow player-drawn paths to attack enemy bases.

### Technical Stack
- Unity 6 (macOS/Apple Silicon)
- C# targeting iOS/Android/Desktop

## Developer Background
- I am an experienced programmer new to C# and Unity.
- I understand general programming concepts but need guidance on Unity-specific patterns, C# syntax, and best practices for mobile game development with Unity.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use C# with Unity 6 best practices, game development best practices for small projects
- Minimize garbage collection (avoid frequent `new` allocations)
- Name variables and methods descriptively
- Follow C# naming conventions: `PascalCase` for public members, `camelCase` for private fields

### Architecture Guidelines
- Prefer component-based design (MonoBehaviours)
- State management for game modes (PathDrawing etc.)
- Mobile-optimized rendering and physics

## Additional Guidelines
- Keep existing comments when possible, especially the TODO comments.

## Unity API Guidelines
- Use `Object.FindFirstObjectByType<T>()` instead of deprecated `Object.FindObjectOfType<T>()` for finding scene objects
