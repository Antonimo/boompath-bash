# Step-by-Step Refactor Discipline

When executing a planned refactor with defined steps:

## 📋 Before Starting
- **Read the workplan file completely** - understand the full context and guidelines
- **Follow ALL specific guidelines** defined in the workplan document
- **Consult collaboration rules** and behavioral constraints in the plan

## 🚫 Critical Rules
- **ONLY do what the current step explicitly asks for**
- **DO NOT anticipate future steps** - step boundaries are sacred
- **Read step tasks word-for-word before starting**
- **Stop immediately after the step is complete**

## ⚠️ Expected During Refactor
- **Compilation errors are normal and expected during migration**
- **Broken intermediate states are intentional**
- **Files become empty as a RESULT of moving code, not as a GOAL**

## ✅ Success Pattern
- Progressive completion: each step moves specific code pieces
- Clear progress tracking: mark completed tasks
- Disciplined scope: resist the urge to "fix everything at once"
