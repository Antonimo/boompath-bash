# No Compilation/Building Attempts

**Important: Do not attempt to compile, build, or run terminal commands to check for compilation errors/warnings.**

## Guidelines
- The user prefers to handle compilation and error checking themselves
- Do not run Unity builds, compiler commands, or similar tools to verify code changes
- Do not suggest running compilation commands unless explicitly asked
- Trust that the user will test and compile their own code
- Focus on code analysis through reading and understanding rather than compilation

## What to do instead
- Analyze code statically by reading files
- Use grep/search tools to find issues
- Provide code fixes based on understanding of language syntax and Unity APIs
- Explain potential issues but let the user verify them through compilation
