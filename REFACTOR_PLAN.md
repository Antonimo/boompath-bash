# GameManager Refactor - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Merge `NetworkGameManager` and `GameManager` into a single `GameManager` that inherits from `NetworkBehaviour`, while simplifying the state management and clarifying the distinction between global game states and local player interactions.

**Core Insight**: The game became overly complex by trying to separate networking from game logic. Instead, we should embrace that global game states need network synchronization, while local player interactions should be managed separately per-client.

**Approach**: Direct code migration - move code piece by piece, **removing from old managers as we go**. Make adjustments and test only at the very end of the whole refactor workplan.

## Architectural Vision & Key Insights

### State Management Philosophy

- **Global Game States** (synced across all clients): Loading, WaitingForPlayers, Playing, GameOver
- **Local Player States** (per-client, not synced): PlayerTurn, DrawingPath, TurnComplete
- **State Transition Pattern**: Update-based polling for condition checking (simpler than coroutines)

### Game Type Clarification

- **NOT a turn-based networked game**: Each networked player plays simultaneously
- **Turn-based only for local co-op**: Multiple players sharing the same screen take turns
- **Each client manages its own player interaction flow** during the global "Playing" state

### Architecture Simplification Goals

1. **Merge NetworkGameManager + GameManager**: Eliminate artificial separation between networking and game logic
2. **Create dedicated PlayerInteractionManager**: Handle per-client player states and interactions
3. **Reduce complexity**: The original simple game logic should remain simple, with networking as an enhancement, not a complication
4. **Use Update-based state management**: Replace coroutine complexity with simple per-frame condition checking

### Key Architectural Insights

- **Pre-networking simplicity**: The game worked fine with minimal code before networking
- **Complexity explosion**: Adding networking increased complexity ~10x due to over-separation
- **Events/Actions usage**: May be contributing to complexity - needs evaluation during refactor
- **Global vs Local state confusion**: Mixing network-synced states with local player states created unnecessary complexity
- **State Machine Logic Depth**: The existing GameState machine contains substantial game logic within individual states that must be carefully preserved during consolidation - this is not just about state transitions but about preserving behavioral logic embedded in each state class

### Future Considerations

- Player states (PlayerTurn, DrawingPath) could be networked for visibility of other players' actions
- This would be for practice/enhancement, not core functionality

## Migration Strategy

- **Progressive Emptying**: As code is moved to new GameManager, **remove it from old managers**
- **Clear Progress Tracking**: Empty old manager files = migration complete
- **No Interim Testing**: Expect compilation errors until final phase
- **Reference Preservation**: Keep old manager files for reference until completely empty
- **File Management**: Empty files progressively by removing code until only class structure remains. **User handles actual file deletion at the end of the workplan.**
- **State Machine Logic Preservation**: The old GameState machine contains specific behaviors for each state (entry/exit/update logic) that must be carefully reviewed and mapped to the new simplified NetworkVariable<GameState> system. This is a critical step that cannot be overlooked.

### Critical Migration Requirement: State Logic Review

**The old state machine is not just about state transitions - it contains game logic within each state that must be preserved:**

- **State-specific behaviors**: Each state in `GameState/States/` directory has unique logic
- **Entry/exit actions**: States have specific initialization and cleanup behaviors
- **Update logic**: Some states have per-frame update behaviors that must be mapped
- **Transition conditions**: Complex state transition rules that go beyond simple state changes

**This logic must be systematically reviewed and implemented in the new unified GameManager's `HandleGameStateTransition()` method and related systems. Missing this step would result in broken game flow and lost functionality.**

## Collaboration Guidelines

- One step at a time implementation and review
- AI implements code changes for current step **and stops for user review**
- User reviews before proceeding to next step!
- This workplan file updated LAST in each interaction
- Focus on limited, thematic scope per step
- **Notes section**: **MINIMAL ONLY** - Only add significant decisions, choices, or deviations from the main plan that provide important context beyond what's evident from tasks and code. **Do NOT restate obvious accomplishments or implementation details that are clear from the completed tasks.**

### Notes Review Process (Critical for Minimal Notes)

**Before finalizing any notes, follow this two-step review:**

1. **Write notes first** (if any)
2. **Review each note** and ask: "Does this note tell me something I couldn't figure out from reading the completed tasks and code changes?"
   - If **NO**: Delete the note
   - If **YES**: Keep only the non-obvious part

**Examples of BAD notes (DELETE THESE):**

- "Successfully moved all fields" ‚Üê Just restates the task
- "Fields consolidated from both managers" ‚Üê Just restates what was supposed to happen
- "Removed field declarations as planned" ‚Üê Just restates normal execution
- "Compilation errors expected during migration" ‚Üê Just restates known behavior

**Examples of GOOD notes (KEEP THESE):**

- "Used approach X instead of Y because of compatibility issue Z"
- "Added extra validation step due to discovered edge case"
- "Deviated from plan: skipped step X because it was already handled in step Y"

**Default when in doubt:** Use `[No significant decisions or deviations]` - this is always better than verbose notes.

### AI Behavioral Constraints (Critical for Refactor Success)

**üö´ BLIND COPY-PASTE PROHIBITION (MOST CRITICAL):**

- **DO NOT copy old code as-is without analyzing and adapting it**
- **ANALYZE what each piece of code actually does before moving it**
- **ADAPT code to work with the new unified NetworkBehaviour architecture**
- **REPLACE old patterns with new patterns:**
  - Old: `stateMachine.ChangeState(GameStateType.X)` ‚Üí New: `ChangeGameState(GameState.X)`
  - Old: `gameManager.CurrentState` ‚Üí New: `CurrentState` (NetworkVariable)
  - Old: `IsHost` field ‚Üí New: `IsHost` property from NetworkBehaviour
  - Old: Separate validation in both managers ‚Üí New: Unified validation
- **ELIMINATE dependencies on old systems** (GameStateMachine, separate managers)
- **USE the new architecture's capabilities** (NetworkVariable events, RPC methods, unified state management)

**üö´ TODO COMMENT ADDICTION:**

- **DO NOT add TODO comments instead of doing the actual adaptation work**
- **IMPLEMENT the simplified state system, don't postpone it**
- **ADAPT the logic to NetworkVariable<GameState> in the current step**
- **TODO comments are only for genuinely complex architectural decisions that need separate discussion**

**üö´ ARCHITECTURE BLINDNESS:**

- **UNDERSTAND the target architecture before moving code:**
  - New GameManager is a NetworkBehaviour with NetworkVariable<GameState>
  - Global states (Loading, WaitingForPlayers, Playing, GameOver) are network-synced
  - Local player interactions happen during the global "Playing" state
  - No more GameStateMachine - use simple state management with NetworkVariable
- **TRANSFORM code to fit the new architecture, don't force old architecture into new files**
- **ELIMINATE artificial separation between network and game logic**

**üö´ COMPILATION ERROR PHOBIA OVERRIDE:**

- **DO NOT attempt to "fix" compilation errors during migration steps (Phase 2)**
- **EXPECT broken intermediate states** - this is normal and intended
- **ONLY fix compilation errors in Phase 3 (Fix References and Test)**
- **Compilation errors in old managers are EXPECTED when fields are removed**

**üö´ WORKING CODE COMPULSION OVERRIDE:**

- **DO NOT try to maintain working code at each intermediate step**
- **EMBRACE broken transitional states** - the refactor intentionally breaks things temporarily
- **RESIST the urge to add placeholder implementations or stub methods**
- **Remember: "Big Bang" refactor strategy requires patience with non-working code**

**üö´ SCOPE CREEP PREVENTION:**

- **ONLY do what the current step explicitly asks for**
- **DO NOT anticipate future steps** - even if you see obvious next actions
- **When moving fields: ONLY remove field declarations, LEAVE method implementations intact**
- **When moving methods: ONLY then remove method implementations**
- **Step boundaries are sacred - do not cross them**

**üö´ PROGRESSIVE EMPTYING MISUNDERSTANDING:**

- **"Progressive Emptying" means files become empty as a RESULT of moving code, not a GOAL**
- **DO NOT empty files prematurely**
- **Files should only be empty when ALL their content has been explicitly moved in steps**
- **Empty files are an indicator of completion, not an action to take**
- **EMPTY files by removing code, do NOT delete files - user handles file deletion at end**

**üö´ NAMESPACE/TYPE CONFLICT BLINDNESS:**

- **Pay attention to namespace conflicts (e.g., `GameState` namespace vs `GameState` enum)**
- **When creating new types, avoid conflicting with existing namespace names**
- **Qualify types properly to avoid ambiguity (e.g., `UnityEngine.Object` vs `object`)**
- **Test imports and namespace resolution before assuming types work**

### Refactor Mantras for AI

1. **"Analyze first, adapt second, move third"**
2. **"Transform to new architecture, don't transplant old architecture"**
3. **"NetworkVariable<GameState> replaces GameStateMachine"**
4. **"Unified NetworkBehaviour eliminates artificial separation"**
5. **"Broken code in the middle is expected and healthy"**
6. **"Only do exactly what this step asks, nothing more"**
7. **"Compilation errors are friends during migration phases"**
8. **"Empty files happen naturally, don't force them"**
9. **"Each step has a single, precise responsibility"**

### Step Execution Rules

- **Read the step tasks word-for-word before starting**
- **Identify exactly what needs to be moved/changed in this step only**
- **Make ONLY those changes**
- **Stop immediately after the step is complete**
- **Do not look ahead or try to optimize for future steps**
- **Accept that the current state may be broken - this is intentional**

**Ignore linter errors during refactor** - Linter errors are expected during the migration process due to missing references and incomplete code transitions. Only address compilation issues during the testing phases (Phase 3+).

**Ignore namespace conflicts during refactor** - Namespace conflicts (e.g., `GameState` namespace vs `GameState` enum) are expected during the migration process and will be resolved in Phase 5: Fix References and Basic Testing. Do not attempt to fix these during migration phases.

- **Notes:**
  - Added GameStart state to match existing state machine structure
  - Renamed PlayerTurnPhase values to align with existing conventions (PlayerTurn, PlayerTurnEnd)
  - **Architectural clarification needed**: PlayerTurnPhase should be LOCAL to each client, not globally synced

## Phase 2: Basic GameManager Consolidation ‚úì COMPLETE

### ‚úì Step 2.1: Create GameManager Foundation

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Create `Assets/Scripts/Game/GameManager.cs` inheriting from `NetworkBehaviour`

  - ‚úì Add core Unity lifecycle methods (Awake, Start, OnDestroy, OnNetworkSpawn)
- **Notes:**
  - [No significant decisions or deviations]

### ‚úì Step 2.2: Move ALL Fields and Properties

- **Tasks:**

  - ‚úì Copy ALL fields from OldNetworkGameManager ‚Üí GameManager, **remove from OldNetworkGameManager**
  - ‚úì Convert state machine to use new simplified GameState enum
  - ‚úì Add [SerializeField] attributes where needed
- **Notes:**
  - [No significant decisions or deviations]

### ‚úì Step 2.3: Move Core Game Lifecycle Methods

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Move Unity lifecycle methods: `Awake()`, `Start()`, `Update()`, `LateUpdate()`
  - ‚úì Move initialization methods: `DelayedInitialization()`, `ValidateDependencies()`, `InitializeStateMachine()`
  - ‚úì **ADAPT methods to new architecture:**
    - Replace `stateMachine` usage with `NetworkVariable<GameState>` logic
    - Remove `InitializeStateMachine()` entirely (no longer needed)
    - Adapt `DelayedInitialization()` to use `ChangeGameState()` instead of `stateMachine.Initialize()`
    - Update `ValidateDependencies()` to validate all consolidated dependencies
    - Remove `Update()` and `LateUpdate()` state machine calls, replace with network-appropriate logic
  - ‚úì **Remove these methods from OldGameManager**
- **Notes:**
  - [No significant decisions or deviations]

### ‚úì Step 2.4: Move Player Management Methods

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Move player-related methods: `ClearPlayers()`, `InitializePlayers()`, `ResetToFirstPlayer()`, `StartNextPlayerTurn()`
  - ‚úì Move player interaction methods: `SelectUnit()`, `ResetSelectedUnit()`, `SetupLocalPlayer()`
  - ‚úì **Remove these methods from OldGameManager**
- **Notes:**
  - **Architectural clarification**: Corrected distinction between global states (Playing, GameOver) and local player interaction states (PlayerTurn, PathDrawing). Local player interactions should occur during global "Playing" state.

- **Notes:**
  - Methods were already present in new GameManager and absent from OldGameManager

### ‚úì Step 2.7: Move Network Lifecycle Methods

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Move NetworkBehaviour lifecycle: `OnNetworkSpawn()`, `OnNetworkDespawn()`
  - ‚úì Move validation methods: `ValidateDependencies()` from OldNetworkGameManager
  - ‚úì **Remove these methods from OldNetworkGameManager**
- **Notes:**
  - [No significant decisions or deviations]

## Phase 3: State Machine Logic Preservation (Steps 3.1-3.8) ‚úì COMPLETE

### ‚úì Step 3.1: Analyze Old GameState Machine Structure

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Review `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/` directory structure and state classes
  - ‚úì Document each state's entry/exit/update behaviors
  - ‚úì Identify state-specific game logic that must be preserved
  - ‚úì Map old GameStateType enum values to new GameState enum values
- **Notes:**
  - **State Architecture**: Old system uses IGameState interface with Enter/Exit/Update/HandleInput methods, managed by GameStateMachine class with event system
  - **Network-Aware States**: GameStateMachine identifies Loading, WaitingForPlayers, Paused, GameOver as network-relevant states requiring cross-client synchronization (to be removed because is no longer relevant with this refactor, all states are network relevant.)
  - **State Mapping Critical Discovery**: New GameState enum has "Playing" state but old system used PlayerTurn/PathDrawing/PlayerTurnEnd as separate states - these need to be treated as LOCAL player phases within the global "Playing" state, not global network states
  - **Key Preserved Behaviors**: LoadingState coroutine with 4s (make it 1s) delay + ClearPlayers, GameStartState game initialization (ResetToFirstPlayer, EnableBases, camera setup), PlayerTurnState local player management, PathDrawingState camera switching and path setup, PlayerTurnEndState transition sequences, GameOverState input disabling, PausedState timeScale management with state restoration
  - **Critical Logic**: State transitions driven by Update() polling, coroutine-based sequences in Loading/PlayerTurnEnd, camera management integration, player turn flow management, pause/resume with previous state restoration

### ‚úì Step 3.2: Implement Loading State Logic

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Replace empty `GameState.Loading` case in `HandleGameStateTransition()` with LoadingState logic
  - ‚úì Implement loading coroutine with 1s delay and `ClearPlayers()` call
  - ‚úì Add automatic transition to `WaitingForPlayers` after loading complete
  - ‚úì **ADAPT logic to work with NetworkVariable<GameState> instead of stateMachine.ChangeState()**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/LoadingState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - **Architectural Decision Pending**: Current implementation uses coroutines, but Update-based polling will be simpler and more manageable for state transitions

### ‚úì Step 3.3: Implement WaitingForPlayers State Logic

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Replace empty `GameState.WaitingForPlayers` case in `HandleGameStateTransition()` with WaitingForPlayersState logic

  - ‚úì Add placeholder for future player readiness checking logic
  - ‚úì **ADAPT logic to work with NetworkVariable<GameState> system**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/WaitingForPlayersState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**

  - ‚úì Add automatic transition to `Playing` state after initialization
  - ‚úì **ADAPT logic to work with NetworkVariable<GameState> instead of stateMachine.ChangeState()**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/GameStartState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - **Hybrid State Management Approach**: Implemented combination of Update-based polling for state transitions with coroutines for loading delays (LoadingSequence as placeholder for actual loading routines)
  - **Simplified State Tracking**: Replaced complex stateTimer/stateInitialized with simple isLoadingComplete boolean flag for cleaner state management
  - **Immediate GameStart Transition**: GameStart state immediately calls StartPlaying() to transition to Playing state after initialization, rather than waiting for polling conditions

### ‚úì Step 3.5: Implement Playing State Logic (Consolidate Player Turn States)

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Replace empty `GameState.Playing` case in `HandleGameStateTransition()` with consolidated player turn logic
  - ‚úì Implement local PlayerTurnPhase management for per-client player interactions
  - ‚úì Consolidate PlayerTurnState, PathDrawingState, and PlayerTurnEndState behaviors into Playing state
  - ‚úì **ADAPT player turn flow to work as local phases within global Playing state**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/PlayerTurnState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/PathDrawingState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/PlayerTurnEndState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - **Local Player Turn Phase Management**: Implemented currentPlayerTurnPhase field for per-client state tracking within global Playing state (removed isTransitioningPlayerTurn field for simpler state management)
  - **Playing State Integration**: Added comprehensive Playing State Management region with StartPlayerTurnPhase(), StartPathDrawingPhase(), CancelPathDrawing(), StartPlayerTurnEndPhase(), and PlayerTurnEndTransitionSequence() methods
  - **Update Integration**: Added UpdatePlayingState() call to main Update() method for continuous input handling and state management during Playing state
  - **Method Updates**: Updated SelectUnit() to call StartPathDrawingPhase() and ConfirmPath() to call StartPlayerTurnEndPhase(), replacing old state machine calls with new local phase management
  - **State Guards**: Added CurrentState != GameState.Playing guards to prevent phase transitions outside of Playing state
  - **User Improvements**: Added TODOs for future enhancements (exit state handling, enter/leave state management, validation optimization, transition logic refinement)

### ‚úì Step 3.6: Implement GameOver State Logic

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Replace empty `GameState.GameOver` case in `HandleGameStateTransition()` with GameOverState logic
  - ‚úì Implement player input disabling and game over setup
  - ‚úì Add game over input handling (restart/quit functionality)
  - ‚úì **ADAPT logic to work with NetworkVariable<GameState> system**
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/GameOverState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - [No significant decisions or deviations]

### ‚úì Step 3.7: Remove Paused State

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì **Remove Paused state from GameState enum** in `Assets/Scripts/Game/GameState.cs`
  - ‚úì **Remove Paused references from GameManager.cs**:
    - Remove `case GameState.Paused:` from `HandleGameStateTransition()`
    - Remove `case GameState.Paused:` from `CanEndGameFromState()`
    - Remove `Pause()` method
    - Update documentation to remove Paused from global states list
  - ‚úì **Remove Paused from GameStateType.cs enum** in old state machine
  - ‚úì **Remove Paused from GameStateMachine.cs NetworkRelevantStates** collection
  - ‚úì **Remove Paused methods from OldNetworkGameManager.cs**:
    - Remove `case GameStateType.Paused:` and `HandleGamePaused()` call
    - Remove `HandleGamePaused()` method
    - Remove `GamePausedClientRpc()` method
    - Remove `ShowPauseUI()` method
  - ‚úì **Empty `Assets/Scripts/Game/States/PausedState.cs` file (leave only class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - **Architectural Decision**: Removed Paused state entirely per user request - game no longer needs pause functionality
  - **Simplified State Flow**: Game now has clean 4-state progression: Loading ‚Üí WaitingForPlayers ‚Üí Playing ‚Üí GameOver
  - **Network Simplification**: Eliminated pause-related RPC methods and timeScale management complexity

### ‚úì Step 3.8: Remove Old State Machine Dependencies

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Remove old `GameStateMachine` references from consolidated GameManager code
  - ‚úì Update any remaining `stateMachine.ChangeState()` calls to use `ChangeGameState()`
  - ‚úì Clean up old state machine imports and dependencies

  - ‚úì Move UI methods: `ShowGameOverUI()`
  - ‚úì **Remove these methods from OldNetworkGameManager (file should now be empty except class structure)**
- **Notes:**
  - **Methods Already Consolidated**: All target utility methods (DetermineWinnerClientId, AreAllPlayersSpawned, GetWinnerPlayerName, GetPlayerByClientId, ShowGameOverUI) were already present in GameManager with proper adaptation
  - **Final Cleanup**: Removed all remaining method comment references from OldNetworkGameManager, leaving only class structure and documentation

### ‚úì Step 4.5: Verify Old Manager Files Are Empty

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Confirm OldGameManager.cs contains only empty class structure
  - ‚úì Confirm OldNetworkGameManager.cs contains only empty class structure
  - ‚úì Document any remaining dependencies or references
- **Notes:**
  - **OldGameManager.cs**: Contains only class definition with documentation comments, all implementation moved to new GameManager

### ‚úì Step 5.2: Update All External References

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Find all scripts referencing OldGameManager and update to GameManager
  - ‚úì Find all scripts referencing OldNetworkGameManager and update to GameManager
  - ‚úì **In Unity Editor:** Update scene references to use new GameManager component (user will handle in Unity Editor)
- **Notes:**
  - **External References Updated**: Updated PrivateMatchManager and PrivateMatchGameOverController to use GameManager instead of NetworkGameManager
  - **All Code References Fixed**: No remaining code references to old manager classes found

### ‚úì Step 5.3: Basic Functionality Verification

  - **Fast-Track Cleanup Complete**: All major compilation errors resolved, ready for user testing

## Phase 5.5: Post-Testing Architecture Refinements ‚úì COMPLETE

### ‚úì Step 5.5.1: Remove Loading State

- **Tasks:**

  - ‚úì Update initial state field from Loading to WaitingForPlayers
  - ‚úì Remove loading-related fields (isLoadingComplete boolean)
  - ‚úì Remove Loading state logic from HandleStateUpdates() and HandleGameStateTransition()
  - ‚úì Remove LoadingSequence() coroutine method
  - ‚úì Remove LoadGame() method
  - ‚úì Update class documentation to clarify loading is local per client
- **Notes:**
  - **Architectural Insight**: Loading should not be a network-synced state since each client handles their own loading independently
  - **Better Reconnection Support**: Clients can now handle loading when reconnecting mid-game without affecting global state
  - **Simplified State Flow**: Clean 4-state progression: WaitingForPlayers ‚Üí GameStart ‚Üí Playing ‚Üí GameOver

### ‚úì Step 5.5.2: Relocate ClearPlayers() Call

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚úì Move ClearPlayers() call from removed LoadGame() to SetupAndLaunchGameClientRpc()
  - ‚úì Remove SetupClientManagers() method call and implementation (no longer needed)
- **Notes:**
  - **Better Architecture**: ClearPlayers() now happens during setup phase on all clients, not during state transitions
  - **Logical Replacement**: Effectively replaces the removed LoadGame() call in the same ClientRpc method
  - **Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary SetupClientManagers() method that only contained comments and debug logs

## Phase 6: Analyze and Optimize Architecture (Steps 6.1-6.3)

### ‚òê Step 6.1: Review Consolidated GameManager

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚òê Create `Assets/Scripts/Game/PlayerInteractionManager.cs` as MonoBehaviour
  - ‚òê Design interface for local player interactions during global "Playing" state
  - ‚òê Move identified local player methods/fields if beneficial
- **Notes:**
  - [To be filled after completion]

### ‚òê Step 6.3: Final Architecture Validation

- **Tasks:**
  - ‚òê Test complete game flow from start to finish
  - ‚òê Verify network synchronization works correctly
  - ‚òê Validate that original functionality is fully restored
  - ‚òê Document final architecture decisions and improvements
- **Notes:**
  - [To be filled after completion]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All code consolidated from old managers into new GameManager
- [ ] Old manager files completely empty (ready for deletion)
- [ ] Game state management simplified to enum-based system
- [ ] **All state machine logic preserved and properly implemented in new architecture**
- [ ] **State-specific behaviors (entry/exit/update) mapped to new system**
- [ ] Local player interactions identified and potentially separated
- [ ] All compilation errors resolved
- [ ] Original functionality restored
- [ ] Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Risk Mitigation

- Expect breaking changes during migration - fix at the very end of this workplan
- Focus on consolidation first, analysis second
- **Remove code from old managers as we move it** - creates clear progress tracking
- **Empty old manager files indicate completion**
- Compilation errors expected until Phase 3
- Keep commit history for rollback if needed

## Architectural Discoveries & Decisions

_This section tracks important insights, decisions, and architectural clarifications discovered during the refactor process._

### Pre-Refactor Analysis

- **Events/Actions Complexity**: Need to evaluate if current event system is contributing to over-complexity
- **State Confusion**: Original architecture mixed global network states with local player states
- **Separation Overhead**: Artificial separation between networking and game logic created unnecessary complexity
- **Code Review Discovery**: OldGameManager contains mostly local player interaction logic (turn management, unit selection, path drawing), while OldNetworkGameManager handles network coordination and RPC calls

### During Refactor (To be updated as we progress)

[Discoveries and decisions will be added here as we encounter them]

- **AI Behavioral Issues Identified**: Compilation error phobia, working code compulsion, scope creep, progressive emptying misunderstanding, and namespace conflict blindness
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive AI Behavioral Constraints to the collaboration guidelines
- **State Management Architecture Decision**: Chose Update-based polling over coroutines for state transitions. Coroutines add unnecessary complexity for simple condition checking (player readiness, loading completion). Update-based approach is simpler, easier to debug, matches original pattern, and eliminates coroutine lifecycle management complexity.

## Current Progress & Next Steps

**Next action:** Step 6.1 (Architecture Review)

_This section will be updated after each completed step to track progress_

## Post-Refactor Followup Items

_Items that need attention after the main consolidation is complete_

### Local Player State Management

- **TODO in `StartNextPlayerTurn()`**: Should trigger local PlayerTurn state, not global state changes
- **TODO in `SelectUnit()`**: Should trigger local PathDrawing state, not global state changes
- **Resolution**: Address in Phase 4 PlayerInteractionManager creation - design local state machine for per-client player interactions during global "Playing" state

### Code Quality & Architecture

- **GameState namespace conflict**: Fix compilation errors with GameState enum vs GameState namespace
- **Object.FindFirstObjectByType ambiguity**: Qualify as UnityEngine.Object.FindFirstObjectByType
- **IsHost field redundancy**: Replace custom IsHost field with NetworkBehaviour.IsHost property
- **RequestUnitPathAssignment review**: Current implementation routes through CurrentPlayer.RequestUnitPathAssignment() because GameObject wasn't originally a NetworkBehaviour. Now that GameManager is a NetworkBehaviour, this flow could potentially be simplified - maybe GameManager can directly handle unit path assignment via ServerRpc instead of routing through Player objects.
