# Lobby Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring removes the need to poll Unity Game Services (UGS) Lobby servers and centralizes all lobby functionality into a reusable singleton service. The main focus was to eliminate polling because the UGS multiplayer package already handles the connection to lobby servers well through real-time events.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created LobbyService Singleton (`Assets/Scripts/Services/LobbyService.cs`)

**New centralized service that:**

- Manages all UGS lobby functionality (authentication, creation, joining, events)
- Uses UGS lobby events for real-time updates instead of polling
- Maintains local lobby state that is kept up-to-date via event subscription
- Broadcasts lobby state changes to UI components and game logic
- Provides a centralized interface for all lobby operations

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Event-Driven**: Uses UGS lobby events for real-time updates, eliminating the need for polling
- **Always Current State**: Local lobby state is maintained through events, so it's always up-to-date
- **Centralized**: Single point of truth for all lobby operations
- **Reusable**: Can be used across different game modes

### 2. Refactored PrivateMatchManager (`Assets/Scripts/Multiplayer/PrivateMatchManager.cs`)

**Removed:**

- All lobby creation/joining logic (moved to LobbyService)
- All lobby event subscription and handling (moved to LobbyService)
- All lobby state management and broadcasting (moved to LobbyService)
- All polling logic and throttling mechanisms (no longer needed)
- All heartbeat management (moved to LobbyService)
- Authentication logic (moved to LobbyService)
- Duplicate `OnLobbyStateBroadcast` event (now only in LobbyService)

**Kept and Focused On:**

- Relay server allocation and client connection
- Game countdown management
- Integration with HostStartupManager and NetworkGameManager
- Game-specific logic

**Now depends on LobbyService for:**

- Lobby operations (create, join, leave)
- Player data updates (ready state, display name)
- Lobby state information

### 3. Updated All UI Controllers

**PrivateMatchLobbyController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PrivateMatchLobbyController.cs`):**

- Removed PrivateMatchManager dependency
- Now uses `LobbyService.Instance.LobbyCode` for getting lobby code
- Uses `LobbyService.Instance.RequestLobbyStateBroadcast()` instead of polling

**PrivateMatchCreateController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PrivateMatchCreateController.cs`):**

- Removed PrivateMatchManager dependency
- Now uses `LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync()` for lobby creation

**PrivateMatchJoinController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PrivateMatchJoinController.cs`):**

- Removed PrivateMatchManager dependency
- Now uses `LobbyService.Instance.JoinLobbyByCodeAsync()` for joining lobbies

**PrivateMatchGameOverController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PrivateMatchGameOverController.cs`):**

- Removed PrivateMatchManager dependency
- Now uses `LobbyService.Instance.LeaveLobbyAsync()` for leaving lobbies

**LobbyPlayerListController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/LobbyPlayerListController.cs`):**

- Already updated in previous refactoring
- Now subscribes to `LobbyService.OnLobbyStateBroadcast` instead of `PrivateMatchManager.OnLobbyStateBroadcast`
- Uses `LobbyService.Instance.RequestLobbyStateBroadcast()` instead of polling
- Delegates player operations to LobbyService

**PlayerLobbyItemController (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PlayerLobbyItemController.cs`):**

- Updated comments to reference the lobby system instead of PrivateMatchManager

### 4. Recreated LobbyServiceInitializer (`Assets/Scripts/Services/LobbyServiceInitializer.cs`)

Simple helper script to ensure LobbyService singleton is created in scenes that need lobby functionality. Provides an option to auto-create the service if not found.

## Eliminated Polling Logic

### What Was Removed:

- `RequestLobbyStateRefresh()` method and all its complexity
- `ExecuteFullLobbyFetchAsync()` and throttling logic
- `DelayedLobbyFetchCoroutine()` and queuing mechanisms
- All API cooldown tracking (`_apiCooldownEndTime`, `MIN_API_CALL_INTERVAL`)
- Queued fetch coroutine management (`_queuedFetchCoroutine`)

### Why Polling Is No Longer Needed:

1. **UGS Events**: The UGS multiplayer package provides real-time events for lobby changes
2. **Always Current**: Local state is maintained through events, so it's always up-to-date
3. **Immediate Updates**: Operations return updated lobby objects, which are immediately available
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: UI and game logic react to events rather than requesting data

## State Broadcasting Logic Preservation

The "broadcast lobby state" functionality has been preserved but improved:

### How It Works Now:

1. **Event-Driven Updates**: LobbyService maintains current state via UGS events
2. **Immediate Broadcasting**: State is broadcast immediately after successful operations
3. **No Polling Required**: `RequestLobbyStateBroadcast()` simply broadcasts current state
4. **Always Current**: Since state is maintained via events, it's always up-to-date

### For UI Components:

- Call `LobbyService.Instance.RequestLobbyStateBroadcast()` in `OnEnable()`
- Subscribe to `LobbyService.OnLobbyStateBroadcast` for updates
- No need to poll or request refreshes

## Integration Guide

### For New Game Modes:

1. Use `LobbyService.Instance` for all lobby operations
2. Subscribe to `LobbyService.OnLobbyStateBroadcast` for lobby state updates
3. Subscribe to `LobbyService.OnLobbyDeleted` for cleanup
4. Subscribe to `LobbyService.OnLobbyError` for error handling

### For UI Components:

```csharp
void OnEnable()
{
    LobbyService.OnLobbyStateBroadcast += HandleLobbyStateUpdate;
    LobbyService.Instance.RequestLobbyStateBroadcast(); // Get current state
}

void OnDisable()
{
    if (LobbyService.Instance != null)
    {
        LobbyService.OnLobbyStateBroadcast -= HandleLobbyStateUpdate;
    }
}
```

### For Game Logic:

```csharp
// Create lobby
string lobbyCode = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync("My Lobby", true);

// Join lobby
bool success = await LobbyService.Instance.JoinLobbyByCodeAsync(lobbyCode);

// Toggle ready state
await LobbyService.Instance.ToggleLocalPlayerReadyState();

// Leave lobby
await LobbyService.Instance.LeaveLobbyAsync();
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **No More Polling**: Eliminates unnecessary API calls and rate limiting concerns
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Uses UGS events for immediate state synchronization
3. **Centralized**: Single point of truth for all lobby functionality
4. **Reusable**: Can be used across different game modes and scenes
5. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns between lobby management and game-specific logic
6. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary API calls or cooldown management
7. **Easier Debugging**: Clear event flow and centralized state management

## Setup Instructions

1. **Add LobbyServiceInitializer**: Place the `LobbyServiceInitializer` component on a GameObject in scenes that need lobby functionality
2. **Update UI**: All UI components have been updated to use LobbyService events instead of PrivateMatchManager
3. **Update Game Logic**: All game logic now uses LobbyService for lobby operations instead of PrivateMatchManager methods

The LobbyService will persist across scene loads via `DontDestroyOnLoad`, ensuring consistent lobby state throughout the application.
